## Rules of BlackJack

Blackjack is a card game where the objective is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over, or "busting". The game is typically played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and each card has a point value. Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are worth 10 points each, and aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what is more advantageous for the player.

At the start of each round, players place their bets and receive two cards face-up, while the dealer receives one card face-up and one card face-down. Players can then choose to "hit" and receive additional cards to improve their hand, or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer must hit until they have a hand value of 17 or more.

If a player's hand value exceeds 21, they automatically lose, or "bust". If a player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's, without exceeding 21, they win. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, all remaining players win. If the dealer's hand value is closer to 21 than a player's, the player loses their bet. In some variations of the game, players can also choose to "double down" by doubling their bet and receiving only one additional card, or "split" pairs of identical cards into two separate hands.

## Program 

I wrote this program on my 8th day of 100DaysOfCode. I made use of a variety of concepts such as Lists, functions, conditional statements. I hope you find the game amusing. Enjoy!

## System Requirements

Python 3 above.
