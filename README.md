# 100DaysOfCode

Welcome to my repository of projects created during my 100 Days of Code challenge!

This repository is a collection of small, silly, and trivial projects that I've created while working through the 100 Days of Code challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to build my coding skills and have fun while doing it.

The projects in this repository are by no means production-ready, and I'm uploading them for fun and to keep track of my progress. Feel free to take a look and use the code as you see fit.

Enjoy!
