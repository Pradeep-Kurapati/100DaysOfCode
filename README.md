# 100DaysOfCode

Welcome to my repository of projects created during my 100 Days of Code challenge!

This repository is a collection of small, silly, and trivial projects that I've created while working through the 100 Days of Code challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to build my coding skills and have fun while doing it.

The projects in this repository are by no means production-ready, and I'm uploading them for fun and to keep track of my progress. Feel free to take a look and use the code as you see fit.

## Day 1: 🚀 Setting Up the System
Today, I set up my system and installed all the necessary tools for my coding journey. I installed my favorite code editor and checked my system configuration to ensure it meets the required specifications. I also created this repository to track my progress and started working on the prerequisites.

## Day 2: 🎓 Learning Basic Concepts
Today, I learned about variables, data types, type checking, conversions, basic arithmetic, control flow, and logical operators. I also practiced implementing them in Python by writing some simple programs.

## Day 3: 🎲 Building Games and Generators
Today, I learned about randomization, the split function, lists, and nested lists in Python. I used this knowledge to build a rock, paper, scissors game and a password generator. It was exciting to see my programs come to life!

## Day 4: 📝 Understanding Functions and Loops
Today, I learned about functions, while loops, and how to use them in Python. I put this knowledge to use by building a hangman game, which was challenging but also very rewarding.

## Day 5: 🔑 Implementing Functions with Parameters
Today, I learned about functions with parameters and how to use them to build a Caesar cipher program. It was great to see how the cipher worked and how I could customize it using different parameters.

## Day 6: 📚 Exploring Dictionaries and Nesting
Today, I learned about dictionaries and how to use them to store and access key-value pairs in Python. I also learned about nesting and used this knowledge to build a program for a silent auction.

## Day 7: 📝 Documenting Code and Recursion
Today, I learned about docstrings and how to use them to document my code in Python. I also learned about recursion and put this knowledge to use by building a basic calculator program.

## Day 8: ♠️ Building a Blackjack Game
Today, I put my skills to the test by building a fully-functional blackjack game in Python. It was challenging, but I enjoyed every minute of it and learned a lot about game development.

## Day 9: 🎯 Understanding Scope and Building Games
Today, I learned about scope in Python and how it affects variables and functions. I put this knowledge to use by building a guessing game and a higher-lower game. It was a great way to practice my new skills and see how they can be applied in different contexts.

## Day 10: ☕ Getting Started with Object Oriented Programming
Today, I learned about object oriented programming basics. I built a Coffee machine program using both Procedural Programming as well as Object Oriented Programming to 
only to realise object oriented programming approach drastically reduced code size and offered better management of code. I also used modules today! I used PrettyTable Module to create a list of Pokemon and their type. Modules are really powerful and shockingly portable.

## Day 11: 🐢 I'm Loving Turtle
TOday, I further explored module concept by using turtle module. Today is by far, the most colourful day in 100daysofcode journey. I literally made art using Python. I 
drew a lot of things from basic shapes to Spirograph, Damien Hirst's spotted painting. 

## Day 12: 🐍 Snake Game, Etch a Sketch, Turtle Race
Today, I further made beautiful projects using the power of object oriented programming. I created a very fun Etch-a-sketch game and then I created a turtle race game but the ultimate project for today is the classic snake game. I'm very proud of what is built.
